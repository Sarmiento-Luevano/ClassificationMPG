# ClassificationMPG
In this project, I apply some classification methods in order to predict the miles per galon (MPG) expenditure of cars. This work goes from visualizing the data and getting a glimpse of how MPG may be predicted, training models implementing logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis and naive Bayes and finally evaluating performance.
