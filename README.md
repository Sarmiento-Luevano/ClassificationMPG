## Gas Mileage Prediction: Classification

This project aims to predict whether a car has a gas mileage (MPG) above the median using classification algorithms.

### Overview
The dataset is explored to understand the available features, their data types, and their relationships with MPG. Visualization techniques such as scatterplots and correlation matrices are employed for deeper insights.

### Feature Selection and Preprocessing
A binary variable is created to classify cars with MPG above the median, facilitating outlier handling and reducing variable interdependencies.

### Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves the removal of rows with missing values and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

### Model Training
Three classification algorithms—Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes—are trained on the preprocessed data. Confusion matrices visualize model performance.

### Model Evaluation
Various classification metrics are used to evaluate model performance, providing insights into their effectiveness in predicting MPG above the median.
